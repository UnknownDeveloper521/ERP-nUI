The system is already connected to Supabase and the database already exists.
Your job is to build the UI and CRUD logic — DO NOT create or change the database structure.

🎯 Screen Name

Raw Material Receipt

🧩 Tabs (already exist — just keep them working)

Dashboard

Raw Material Receipt

RM Issue

RM Ledger

FG Stock

Stock Adjustment

Alert & Thresholds

➕ New Receipt Button

When the user clicks “New Receipt”, open a form popup or page to capture a Raw Material Receipt entry.

📥 Form Fields (Bind to database fields)

Use the fields that already exist in my database for raw material receipts.
The form should include:

Select Raw Material from a dropdown (load from Raw Material Master table)

Select Vendor from a dropdown (load from Vendor/Supplier table if available)

Receipt No (auto-generated if database already handles it — otherwise allow input)

Purchase Order No (optional)

Supplier Invoice No

Batch / Lot / Reference fields if available in the table

Quantity Received

UOM (auto-fill when material is selected)

Received Date

Remarks / Notes

🔗 Important Binding Rules

Do NOT rename columns.

Map inputs directly to the existing columns in the Raw Material Receipts table.

Use the database’s existing triggers and logic — don’t duplicate calculations in the UI.

🔒 System Logic (UI only — DB already handles backend logic)

After submitting a receipt:

Insert the record into the database

Let the database triggers update stock and ledger

Show a success confirmation

Refresh the list view

📋 Below the form — Receipt List Table

Show all Raw Material Receipt records in a table:

Receipt No

Material Name

Vendor Name

Quantity

UOM

Date

Created / Updated timestamps

Add:

Search

Sort by newest first

Filters by material & date

✏️ Edit & Delete

Allow updating a receipt

Allow deleting if allowed by database rules

🚨 Validation

Quantity must be greater than zero

Required fields cannot be empty

🎨 UI Style

Clean ERP-style layout

Responsive table

Simple form design

⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT

DO NOT modify the database structure

DO NOT create new tables

Use the existing Supabase schema

Use the existing triggers

Just build the UI + API calls so the screens work end-to-end.
